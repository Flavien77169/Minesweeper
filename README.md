# Minesweeper in Python

This project is an implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game in Python. The game uses the **Tkinter** graphical library to create an interactive user interface.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Click on tiles to reveal their content.
- Flagging system to mark suspected mines.
- Different difficulty levels (configured in the code).

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. The **Tkinter** library. This library is included by default in most Python distributions, but ensure it is installed.

### Checking Tkinter
To check if Tkinter is available on your Python installation, open a terminal and type:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

If a Tkinter window opens, it means Tkinter is correctly installed.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd minesweeper-python
```

2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

## Running the Program
To start the game, simply run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

A window with the Minesweeper graphical interface will open.
